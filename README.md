## Installation

### Quick Start with npx

```bash
docker run -i --rm followthewhit3rabbit/camoufox-mcp:latest
```

### NPM Installation

Install globally:

```bash
npm install -g camoufox-mcp-server
```

Or add to your project:

```bash
npm install camoufox-mcp-server
```

## Usage

Once configured, the Camoufox MCP server provides a `browse` tool that your AI assistant can use to navigate websites and retrieve content.

### Natural Language Triggers

The AI assistant will automatically use the browse tool when you use phrases like:

**Basic Browsing:**
- "**Search** for information about..."
- "**Visit** this website: ..."
- "**Check** what's on ..."
- "**Navigate** to ..."
- "**Fetch** content from ..."
- "**Browse** to ..."
- "**Go to** the website ..."
- "**Open** this page: ..."
- "**Look at** this URL: ..."
- "**Scrape** data from ..."

**Privacy & Stealth:**
- "Browse **anonymously**..."
- "Visit **privately**..."
- "Browse in **stealth mode**..."
- "**Hide my IP** while browsing..."
- "Browse **through a proxy**..."
- "**Block tracking** while visiting..."

**Screenshots:**
- "**Take a screenshot** of..."
- "**Capture an image** of..."
- "**Show me visually** what ... looks like"
- "I want to **see how** ... appears"

**Performance:**
- "**Quick browse** to..."
- "**Fast loading** of..."
- "Browse **without images**..."
- "**Lightweight browsing** to..."
- "**Text-only** content from..."

### Basic Usage Examples

```
Can you check what's on example.com?
```

```
Search for information on the latest tech news from techcrunch.com
```

```
Visit github.com and tell me what's trending
```

The AI will automatically use the browse tool to navigate to websites and retrieve their HTML content.

### Advanced Usage

```
Please visit example.com using a Windows browser with a 1920x1080 viewport and wait for all resources to load. Take a screenshot too.
```

### More Conversational Examples

```
I need to research the current stock price of Apple. Can you go to finance.yahoo.com and search for AAPL?
```

```
Check if the restaurant's website has their menu online. Visit bistro-example.com and look for their menu section.
```

```
I'm looking for job postings in tech. Can you browse to linkedin.com/jobs and see what's available?
```

```
Navigate to the documentation site for React and find information about hooks.
```

The AI can use advanced parameters like:
- `os`: Spoof operating system (windows, macos, linux)
- `waitStrategy`: How to wait for page load (domcontentloaded, load, networkidle)
- `timeout`: Maximum time to wait (5-300 seconds)
- `viewport`: Custom browser dimensions
- `screenshot`: Capture a screenshot
- `humanize`: Enable realistic mouse movements
- `locale`: Set browser locale (e.g., 'en-US', 'fr-FR')
- `block_webrtc`: Block WebRTC for privacy
- `proxy`: Use a proxy server for requests
- `enable_cache`: Enable browser caching
- `window`: Set fixed window size

### Example with Privacy Options

```
Browse example.com with WebRTC blocked and through a proxy server proxy.example.com:8080
```

### Example with Custom Preferences

```
Visit example.com with a fixed 1280x720 window size and custom Firefox preferences to disable JavaScript
```

### Example with Performance Optimization

```
Browse news.example.com with images blocked for faster loading and a 10 second timeout
```

### Privacy & Stealth Examples

```
Browse example.com anonymously with maximum privacy and stealth mode
```

```
Visit sensitive-site.com through a proxy to hide my IP address
```

```
Browse privately to banking-site.com with WebRTC blocked and fingerprint protection
```

```
Access geo-blocked content via proxy server proxy.example.com:8080
```

### Screenshot Examples

```
Take a screenshot of the homepage at example.com
```

```
Capture an image of how the login page looks on mobile-site.com
```

```
Show me visually what the product page looks like on store.example.com
```

### Performance & Speed Examples

```
Quick browse to news-site.com without loading images for faster access
```

```
Lightweight browsing to documentation-site.com, text content only
```

```
Fast loading of search results from search-engine.com, no images needed
```

### Advanced Privacy Combinations

```
Visit example.com with WebRTC blocked, WebGL blocked, images blocked, and geoip detection disabled
```

```
Browse anonymously through proxy 192.168.1.100:8080 with username 'user' and password 'pass' to access restricted content
```

### Cross-Origin & Iframe Interaction

```
Browse iframe-test.example.com with Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy disabled to allow clicking elements in iframes
```

```
Access embedded content on complex-site.com and interact with all iframe elements
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Camoufox browser not found"**
   - Run `npx camoufox fetch` to download the browser
   - For Docker, the browser is pre-installed

2. **"Cannot find module"**
   - Ensure you've run `npm install` or are using npx
   - For global install: `npm install -g camoufox-mcp-server`

3. **"MCP server not responding"**
   - Check that the server is properly configured in your AI assistant
   - Verify the command path is correct
   - Check logs for error messages

### Debug Mode

To see detailed logs, run the server directly:

```bash
node dist/index.js
```
